# Plan your shopping trip with groceryList
## From the recipes to the store aisle, groceryList is meal planning made easy.

Pick the recipes you want to make this week and groceryList will prepare a shopping list for you.
groceryList knows what you need for each recipe, and it knows where it is in the store you're shopping at.

Add list items all at once for a certain recipe, or just one a time for the extras you need to pick up. You can select the store you're going to shop at and groceryList will sort your list based on that store's aisles.

<span style="font-size: x-small; color: #aaaaaa;">This version of groceryList has preloaded recipes and grocery stores. Future versions may support adding your own within the app, but for now, this is a project specifically for my family, so if you want to adapt it, you'll have to fork the repo and do so in the code.</span>
